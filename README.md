Summary: Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

2. there is a little reduction on the budget when the 9th grade score was removed
3. there is no significant change in the school size
4. there is no significant change in the school type
